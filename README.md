Thanks akretion and team for the project !! ;)

Since I am in a hurry and need quick crappy fix I forked the project.
I voluntary did not act directly on the project because I still experimenting the thing
to make the project work with my version of Rails 4.0.0 and Ruby 2.0.0. 

At the moment I did not feel like investing the time to make a clean patch.
Though they did a great job, I am not really a fan of the rails integration,
if my experiment are successfull I will propose some changes to the main project.
